## n JavaScript, the break statement is only allowed within loops (like for, while, do-while) and switch statements. It is used to exit the loop prematurely or to exit a switch statement block.

## In the provided code snippet, the break statement is being used within the forEach loop's callback function, which is not allowed because forEach is not a loop construct like for or while. forEach is an array method that iterates over each element of the array and executes a callback function for each iteration, but it does not create a loop control structure.

## for (let i = 0; i < allinputs.length; i++) {
            if (allinputs[i].value == '') {
                break;
            }
            val++;
